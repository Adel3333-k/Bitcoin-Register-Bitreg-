Full Project Proposal: Bitcoin Project Verification
& Integrity Infrastructure (BPVII)
1. Executive Summary
The Bitcoin ecosystem is rapidly expanding, attracting developers, educators, circular economy
builders, and global funding partners. However, gaps in accountability, verification, and project integrity
have resulted in misallocated resources, nepotism-based initiatives, and reputational risks.
The Bitcoin Project Verification & Integrity Infrastructure (BPVII) is a trust-layer designed to verify,
authenticate, and standardize Bitcoin project legitimacy across the world. This platform provides a
transparent, ethical, and community-driven verification system that ensures only credible, impactful,
and professionally run projects receive support.
BPVII introduces a structured project assessment protocol, risk scoring system, and a public directory of
vetted Bitcoin initiatives accessible to funders, communities, and ecosystem partners.
2. Problem Statement
Despite Bitcoin's growth, the ecosystem faces critical challenges:
• Funding is often allocated without proper scrutiny.
• Some projects are family-run or nepotism-based with no real impact.
• False claims, exaggerated metrics, and fabricated track records are common.
• Funders lack an objective way to assess credibility.
• Communities struggle to differentiate legitimate builders from opportunists.
• Projects without integrity damage the reputation and sustainability of the Bitcoin movement.
There is no standardized, ecosystem-wide solution for verifying authenticity, credibility, and impact.
3. Project Goal
To build a global, transparent, and community-integrity framework that verifies, documents, and
validates Bitcoin-related projects across developers, educators, circular economy builders, and
community initiatives.
4. Project Objectives
1. Establish a structured, neutral verification system for all Bitcoin projects.
2. Develop a digital platform that hosts project profiles, verification statuses, and risk scores.
3. Enable funders and partners to make informed, evidence-based decisions.
4. Promote accountability, transparency, and sustainability within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
5. Protect the community from fraudulent or unserious initiatives.
